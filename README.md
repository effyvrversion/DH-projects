# From Rembrandt to Van Gogh
The theme aims to explore links and patterns between Rembrandt and Van Gogh.

Due to the size limit, I have to make subfiles:
1. Analysis and Visualization: 1.1 Metadata Overview
                               1.2 Van Gogh's Dataset
                               1.3 Rembrandt's Dataset
2. Image Clustering and Semantic Search: CLIP Model(sample) 
3. Storytelling: Website_From Rembrandt to Van Gogh
